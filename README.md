Uniject
=======

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testability">testability</a> framework for <a href="http://www.unity3d.com">Unity3D</a>.

This fork has additional functionality to allow for detection and binding of GameObjects to vanilla C# dependencies on a name-based convention, and some refactorings to support polymorphism across Unity-based components.
Additionally, this fork has extended support for Unity 4.6 and 5.0 types and APIs.
